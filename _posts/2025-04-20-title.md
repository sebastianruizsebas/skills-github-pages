The goal of this website is to document my thoughts and understandings of certain topics I am interested in, as well as to show a bit of my personality, since I don't use social media really. 
My goal is to keep an online presence that at the end of the day is still employable, so I will try to not talk about politics that much. Although I will say that every day more and more things are being dragged into the world of politics, so at the end of the day, my opinion is my own and does not reflect any entity I am affiliated with.
